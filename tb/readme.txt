The tb references external files in the directory test_inputs to fetch a large quantity of test vectors to feed to the tb as inputs.

In the tb, the path of these files have been passed to the simulator as per the system on which it was simulated. 
While simulating it yourself, please change these path strings(file location) in the code to the location of those files on your computer.

The same goes for the file location for the output file. All the results of the tb as performed on the input vector files are saved in the 
directory called "sim_results". Make sure you change the path value of simulation output file to the correct value(i.e, as per your requirements)
before running the simulations.
